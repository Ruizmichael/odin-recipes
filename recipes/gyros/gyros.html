    <h2>Instructions</h2>

    <h3>For the chicken gyro
    </h3>
    <ol>
        <li>To prepare this chicken gyro recipe, start by preparing the marinade for the gyro. In a large bowl, combine
            marinade ingredients and stir well.
        </li>
        <li>On a cutting board, place a piece of plastic wrap over the chicken thighs and pound until about 1 1/2 cm
            thick with a meat mallet or heavy pan.
        </li>
        <li>In another large bowl combine chicken thighs and marinade, stirring well to coat. Cover with plastic wrap
            and refrigerate for at least 2 hours and up to one day.
        </li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 200°C (400°F).
        </li>
        <li>Skewer the chicken thighs individually on a spit (make sure to skewer them pretty tight). In between the
            chicken pieces skewer the onion and peppers.
        </li>
        <li>Bake for about 1- 1 and 1/2 hour, until internal temperature reaches 165°F (75°C)
        </li>
        <li>Let it rest for about 8 minutes and then carve slices with a sharp knife.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>For the tzatziki sauce</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In the meantime prepare the tzatziki sauce for the chicken gyro. Pour in a blender the olive oil and grated
            garlic and blend until combined.
        </li>
        <li>Remove the skin and seeds of the cucumber and grate it into a large bowl. Season with salt and pepper and
            leave aside for 10 minutes. Wrap the grated cucumber in a towel and squeeze, in order to get rid of the
            excess water.
        </li>
        <li>In a bowl, add the cucumber, the blended garlic and oil, the yogurt, 1-2 tbsps of red wine vinegar, a pinch
            of salt and blend, until the ingredients are combined.
        </li>
        <li>Store the tzatziki sauce in the fridge and always serve cold.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>To serve</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the pita breads. Preheat the oven to 250C. Use a cooking brush to oil the pita breads on both sides
            and season with salt and oregano. Place a large oven tray (upside down) at the bottom of the oven and place
            the pita breads on top of the tray. Bake for 2-3 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Chicken gyro is usually served wrapped, like a sandwich. Spread some tzatziki sauce on the pita breads and
            top it with the chicken gyro, some slices of red onion, some sliced tomato and fried potatoes and wrap.
        </li>
        <li>For an easier version of this traditional Greek souvlaki with chicken gyro recipe you can serve with Greek
            yogurt or some mustard and mayonnaise sauce. Enjoy!
