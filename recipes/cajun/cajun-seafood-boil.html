    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Rinse the shrimp with water, Use a pair of scissors to cut off the mustache and legs. Set aside. Soak the
            crawfish in water and rinse a few times until the water becomes clear. Rinse and scrub the Manila clams.
            Drain and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>Combine all the ingredients of the Seafood Boil Seasoning in a bowl. Stir to mix well. Set aside. </li>
        <li>Fill a large stockpot halfway with water and bring to a boil. Add the lemon halves, follow by the shrimp,
            crawfish, Manila clams and corns. Cover the stockpot and cook the seafood and corns until they turn red or
            cooked through, about 2 minutes. Drain the seafood and corns, discard the water and lemon. Set aside. </li>
        <li>While the seafood is cooking, in a big skillet over medium heat, add the butter and stir in the minced
            garlic. Saute the garlic for 1 minute (not brown). Add the Seafood Boil Seasoning and Louisiana hot sauce.
            Stir to mix the spicy butter sauce well. Turn off the heat. </li>
        <li>Transfer the seafood and corn into the spicy sauce, stir to combine well. If you have a small skillet, mix
            the butter sauce and the seafood in two batches. Serve immediately.</li>
